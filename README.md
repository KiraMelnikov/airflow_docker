Troubleshoots
-> If you don't see this page, make sure you have nothing already running on the port 8080
Also, go back to your terminal on Visual Studio Code and check your application with docker-compose ps
All of your "containers" should be healthy as follow:
ï¿¼
If a container is not healthy. You can check the logs with docker logs materials_name_of_the_container
Try to spot the error; once you fix it, restart Airflow with docker-compose down then docker-compose up -d
and wait until your container states move from starting to healthy.
-> If you see this error
ï¿¼
remove your volumes with docker volume prune and run docker-compose up -d again
-> If you see that airflow-init docker container has exited, that's normal :)
If you still have trouble, reach me on the Q/A with your error.
